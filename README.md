# Multi-step Form

A user-friendly multi-step form that guides users through a series of steps to complete a form. This project is designed to improve the user experience by breaking down lengthy forms into manageable sections, reducing user fatigue, and ensuring a smooth and intuitive process.

## Features

- **Step-by-Step Navigation**: Users can complete each step of the sequence, ensuring that they provide all necessary information in a structured manner.
- **Back Navigation**: Users can go back to a previous step to update their selections, providing flexibility and control over their input.
- **Summary and Confirmation**: Users can see a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order, ensuring accuracy before submission.
- **Responsive Design**: The form adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal layout for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover and focus states for all interactive elements enhance the user experience and accessibility.
- **Form Validation**: Users receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made
